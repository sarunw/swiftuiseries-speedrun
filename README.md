#  SwiftUI Series Speedrun
I focus on the following areas:
1. The alignment and size of basic elements should be as correct as possible. 
2. I decided to skip the hard part, like a wheel effect on mode selection and fading effect.
3. Copy and paste as much as possible.

## Tool
1. I use Sketch as a quick ruler.
2. SF Symbols to find icons.
